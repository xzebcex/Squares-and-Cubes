# **Squares and Cubes**

## Description:
The "Squares" and "Cubes" programs are simple Python scripts that calculate and display the squares and cubes of the first ten numbers (1 through 10), respectively.

## Instructions:
To run either program, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program is saved. Then, enter the command "python <filename>" (replace <filename> with the actual name of the file, e.g. "squares.py" or "cubes.py").

## Output:
When the program is run, a list of the first ten numbers' squares or cubes is printed.
The following should appear in the output for "Squares": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
The following output should be produced for "Cubes": [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000].
